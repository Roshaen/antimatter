# ðŸš€CONTRIBUTING GUIDLINES

This project aims to simplify Modern ETL and Data Analytics Engine

## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/antimatter.git 
```

where `YOUR-USERNAME` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
Run `cd antimatter`

```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
Run `git checkout <BRANCH_NAME>`

```

For example:

```
git checkout -b backend
```


## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Make the necessary changes by running 
``` Run docker compose up ```

> **Note:** Substitute `docker compose up` with `docker-compose up` in case the `docker compose` is not a recognized command.


If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add .
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Add <your-name> to the repository"
```

replacing `<your-name>` with your name.

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```

replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.
